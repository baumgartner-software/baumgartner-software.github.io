# Lighthouse Results

This directory contains Lighthouse audit results for the website. Results are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions pipeline after each deployment to the main branch.

## Files

- `lighthouse-*.json` - Detailed Lighthouse audit reports
- `lighthouse-*.html` - Human-readable HTML reports
- `manifest.json` - LHCI manifest file

## Metrics Tracked

- **Performance**: Page loading and runtime performance
- **Accessibility**: How accessible the site is to users with disabilities  
- **Best Practices**: Adherence to web development best practices
- **SEO**: Search engine optimization metrics

Results are automatically uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts and also committed to this directory for historical tracking.

## Important Note

The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to upload Lighthouse results regardless of whether the performance assertions pass or fail. This ensures that results are always available for analysis and improvement by AI models, even when the website doesn't meet the configured performance thresholds.
